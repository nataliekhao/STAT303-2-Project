    "#### Outliers and Influential Points\n",
    "\n",
    "An outlier test obtained by plotting the fitted values of the model against the studentized residuals revealed 51 outliers (out of 1070 training observations) in the model. Although the outliers make up less than 5% of the training observations, it was still necessary to investigate why these outliers existed, and if they affected the quality of the model. The high leverage test (using a leverage cutoff of 4 times the average leverage) revealed that there were 16 high leverage points in the training dataset, but only 1 was a highly influential point (high leverage and outlier). However, removing the influential point increased both the RSE and RMSE and decreased the R-squared of the model– overall, the quality of the model decreased. This remained the case after testing for outliers with multiple values in np.random.seed(). To further our understanding of the causes for the outliers, we investigated the trends between the predictors and the outliers. While all of the other predictors had a normal distribution in the outliers, over 82.35% of the outliers were non-smokers. Thus, we came to the conclusion that there must be some predictors that are not represented in our dataset which are causing these skews. We also chose to keep all outliers and the influential point in the datasets for developing the model because we believe that they remain significant in creating an accurate model, and additional information (such as more predictors) would be needed to consider removing them.

    "The information related to the predictors in our model will be very convenient to acquire for all stakeholders. The predictors in our model are all related to an individual’s health and general demographics (age, smoking history, bmi, region of residence, number of children, sex). Our stakeholders who are consumers of health insurance plans will get results from our model immediately, since they already have the predictor information on hand. It is the same case for healthcare workers (such as medical offices or hospitals. They already have the patient’s information on hand, so getting results from our model will also be immediate for these stakeholders. Our stakeholders who are the healthcare insurance companies will need to acquire information from potential customers before using our model to predict what prices they should be charging. This collection of information is simple for them because they will simply request for information from potential customers. They can then use the model and get results immediately. \n",
    "\n",
    "One point of concern in our model is the lack of some information that would be significant predictors in an insurance premium prediction model. This would include an individual’s income level, job occupation, and whether they would like a more basic or advanced health insurance plan. While our stakeholders all have this information on hand, our training dataset does not. We believe a more accurate model would implement these predictors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another point of concern is the factor of pricing and economy. Our model is one that predicts the price of insurance premiums, but this is also highly reliant on the general state of the economy and healthcare industry. For instance, high rates of inflation or shortage of healthcare supplies will significantly impact pricing across multiple industries. In real life, healthcare insurance companies would adjust their prices according to these rate of inflation in the economy, but our model does not do so. Thus, our model would need to be recalibrated according to more updated training data whenever there are significant changes in the economy. \n"

    "\n",
    "Overall, our model tells stakeholder that individuals who are older, have a smoking history, have a higher bmi, have more children, and who are located in the northeast will have higher health insurance costs. An examples in numerical terms: for every year increase in age, an individual will be charged about $262 more for health insurance premiums. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our conclusion allows the stakeholders to get a relatively accurate estimate for health insurance premium costs. Stakeholders who are health insurance customers will be able to use our model to predict how much they will need to spend on health insurance. This will allow for easier and more accurate budgeting of their personal costs in everyday life. Health insurance customers who are older, have a smoking history, have more children, and have a higher bmi should allocate more money towards health insurance. Stakeholders who are the health insurance companies can use our model to predict how much to charge an individual for health insurance premiums. This will allow the companies to ensure higher profits, as they can minimize errors made in pricing insurance plans with our model. Finally, stakeholders who are the healthcare providers can use our model to predict how much money they will earn from patients. Healthcare insurance premiums are indirectly linked to how much the healthcare provider will earn. Thus, these healthcare providers should use our model when keeping track of their finances, as the model will give them more accurate profit forecasts as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "The RMSE of our model is $4100 and the RSE is 4541, and the R-squared is 0.87. Since the RMSE is smaller than the RSE there is definitely no overfitting in the data (the model seems to be working better for unseen data). As mentioned above, we believe that the model could be improved (lower RMSE and RSE) with additional predictors and information. When looking at how health insurance is typically priced, an individual’s income level and occupation are also considered. Thus, our stakeholders should be aware of this, and consider using both our model and additional information on top of it when pricing health insurance premiums. Another thing mentioned above is that the model should be updated when there are significant change in the economy (inflation and overall price changes). There is no formal timeline for this procedure (as the state of the economy does not follow a constant pattern), but the model should be re-trained with more updated data whenever appropriate. \n"
