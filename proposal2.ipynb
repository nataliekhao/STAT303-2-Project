If you have too many variables, some of which are  correlated or collinear, you may need to do variable selection *(techniques for variable selection that you will learn later in the course - stepwise regression, lasso, ridge regression)*. If the variables do not have a linear relationship with the response, or if some of the modeling assumptions are not satisfied, you may need to transform the predictors and/or the response (variable transformation) to obtain a better fit.\n",

This project tries to shed light into the cost of insurance an individual would have to pay and help individuals estimate their insurance costs based on their personal characteristics.\n",
    "2. Regression: the response variable is the estimated cost of insurance in USD\n",
    "3. Prediction: we want to predict the price of insurance based on a persons' characteristics. We also considered inference since it would be interesting to see which personal characteristic has the most influence on insurance prices.\n",
    "4. We plan to optimize MAE in order to penalize errors equally. It is possible thata few large errors exist given that insurance benefits vary not only by personal characteristics but by company and the extent of benefits provided. Even if there are a few larger errors, we care more about the model's ability to predict accurately on average and emphasize the ability to draw conclusions about the relative influence of each predictor in our inference problem. \n",
    "5. Before choosing the final form of our regression model, we will have to choose the optimal subset of predictors that are relevant in our model through variable selection techniques. We will likely have to transform variables and use interaction variables to better capture non-linear interactions within models. We also plan to run f-tests on the subsets of data that we do choose to include in the final model to ensure the significance of the predictors that we use."
